                  <p class="card-text">This project involved completing tasks within a provided codebase. This project was for practice only as it was meant to be an introduction to using React. After locating comments  in the code with directions it was time to complete the tasks. The tasks involved rendering menu items, maintaining menu state using the state hook, implementing an "addMenuItem" callback hook, and filtering menu items based on user input. Each task was systematically addressed to ensure the proper functioning of the Sidebar component, adhering to the specified requirements and expected behavior as detailed in the provided steps.</p>
                  <p>This was one of the first React projects I completed. It did take a bit of time for me to fully understand the requirements because I was just learning React. This required me to be patient.</p>
                  <p>The point of this project was to understand React so additional styling was not necessary. For that reason, I did not change the style of this page.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">This project involved creating a ToDo app using React Native. The FlatList component provided by React Native was utilized for efficient rendering of tasks. SafeAreaView is also employed to ensure compatibility with different device layouts CheckBoxes, Input, and text elements from React Native Elements are utilized to implement a task management interface. Default tasks are displayed from a state array, each with properties like a unique identifier, completion status, and description. Tasks are styled with a strikethrough effect if completed, and an input box allows users to add new tasks to the list.</p>
                  <p>One challenge I faced was getting the check mark boxes to actually appear in color when selected.</p>
                  <p>I wanted a monochromatic look for this page. I felt that would keep it simple, allowing to user to focus on the main point of the app which is to create your todo list and complete the tasks.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">
                    This project involved creating a simple exercise app with multiple screens. The home screen presents a menu of exercises that have been categorized and are displayed as styled buttons. Upon clicking a button, the corresponding exercise component is rendered, with the exercise name displayed at the top. Components are created to handle these exercises. The RepetitionExercise component allows users to increment a counter of repetitions and reset it, while the DurationExercise component enables users to start and reset a timer. The RepetitionDurationExercise component combines the increment counter and timer features.</p>
                  <p>One challenge was getting the timer feature to work properly. It took some time to set the code up in a way that allowed the timer to function in the way I wanted.</p>
                  <p>This project was the beginning concept I built on for a later project. For that reason, I spent minimal time on the design on the app. I wanted to ensure the app was functional first.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">This project involved building a ToDo app using React Native and implementing features such as a Login screen, Registration screen, and navigation between them using React Navigation. The Login screen consists of two input fields for username and password, with corresponding buttons for login and registration. Upon login, the app navigates to the ToDo screen if the credentials match the stored data. The Registration screen includes input fields for personal details like first name, last name, username, password, etc., with validation for each field based on specific patterns using Regular Expressions. Error messages are displayed dynamically based on input validation, guiding users to enter correct information.</p>
                  <p>One challenge I faced during this project involved making sure the information entered during the signup process was properly saved so it could be used later to login. After trying various versions of code I was finally able to find a solution to work.</p>
                  <p>I chose to keep the colors consitent across all pages. I used brighter colors to help the buttons stand out.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">This project involved building a React Native application with React Native Elements, focusing on creating a Home component that includes a FlatList of buttons for navigating to different exercises. Each exercise type is represented by a screen. The Home component utilizes React Native Element buttons within the FlatList. The DurationExercise, RepetitionExercise and RepetitionDurationExercise components are registered as screens and use navigation params to display activity names, allow users to increase activity count or start timers, and include options to reset activities. Each exercise in the array includes a "Suggested" exercise button for direct navigation and a "Home" button for returning to the Home screen, ensuring smooth navigation flow within the application.</p>
                  <p>I struggled most with getting the "Suggested" button to work on all pages. It took a lot of time adjusting the code before I realized it was overly complicated. In order for the button to work, I just needed to keep the code very simple.</p>
                  <p>I wanted the list of exercise buttons on the home to appear bright and eyecatching. On the individual pages, I decided it was best to keep the design simple so it was clear to the user how to make the timer and increment features work.</p>

                    This project involved the development of a React Native quiz application that supports three types of questions: True/False, Multiple Choice, and Multiple Answer. The app includes a Question component and a Summary component.</p>

                    <p>The Summary component displays all questions, user-selected answers, and the correct answers, calculating and displaying the total score. Navigation between questions and to the Summary screen is facilitated by React Native Navigation. The app's functionality ensures that users cannot navigate back to previous questions, and it accurately totals the user's score based on their answers.</p>
                  <p>One challenge I face was having the results properly show on the summary page. The multiple answer questions weren't highlighting the correct answers so I had to add additional code.</p>
